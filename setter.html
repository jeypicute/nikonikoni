    <p><b>1. Hand Position and Technique</b> Setters must have excellent hand positioning to deliver consistent, clean sets. Hands should form a triangle above the forehead, with fingers spread and slightly bent, using the pads of the fingers for contact.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Footwork and Balance</b> Quick, precise footwork is essential for a setter to get into the correct position to set the ball. They need to adjust their body based on the pass, maintaining balance to deliver an accurate set.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>3. Decision-Making</b> Setters must have a good court sense, understanding which hitter is in the best position to attack. This involves reading the defense and making quick decisions under pressure.</p>
