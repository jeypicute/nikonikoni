    <p><b>1. Approach and Timing</b>
      <br>
The spiker's approach should be explosive, allowing for maximum vertical jump.
      <br>
      <br>
Perfect timing with the setter is critical to connect well with the ball.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Jumping Ability</b>
      <br>
A strong vertical leap gives a spiker the height needed to hit the ball at a downward angle, making it harder to defend.
      <br>
      <br>
Spikers work on both jump power and height to gain an advantage over blockers.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>3. Arm Swing Technique</b>
      <br>
A quick, powerful arm swing is essential for hitting the ball with speed.
      <br>
      <br>
Proper arm mechanics involve leading with the elbow and finishing with a snapping motion of the wrist.</p>
